# Currency Exchange Project

## Problem Statement
Create a dashboard which will allow users to analyze the exchange rates between two currencies
over a period of time. Users should have the option to select weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly
charts. The dashboard should also display the date on which the rate was at its peak (highest) and
the date on which it was at its lowest. Users should be able to print the data in a chart. Input will be
currency exchange rate dataset between a currency pair and will be provided in a file format
Use USD as Base Currency where first currency will always be USD and second currency will be
variable. For instance, currency pairs could be USD/INR, USD/GBP, USD/EUR, USD/CAD etc.
